            <h2>Important  Guidelines</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User-Friendly Interface: The job portal should have a clean and intuitive interface to make it easy for users to navigate and find relevant job listings.</li>
                <li>Responsive Design: Ensure that the job portal is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</li>
                <li>Clear Search Functionality: Implement an effective search feature that allows users to search for jobs based on keywords, location, category, and other relevant filters.</li>
                <li>Easy Job Application Process: Simplify the job application process to encourage more candidates to apply. Include an option to upload resumes and cover letters.</li>
